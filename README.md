# ut-automation-tools
Tools to automate bureaucracy shits at UT.
Wasting $30Bil on the bullshit Olympic 2020 is fine, but $20 spending on a researcher must be justified.

Tools available:
- `srwtimerec`: Clock in and clock out from the timestamp system.

TODOs:
- [] Add `crontab` configs.
- [] (Alternative to `cron`) Add Timer configs.
- [] Confirmation of successful stamps.
